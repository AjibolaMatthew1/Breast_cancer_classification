## Classifying Breast cancer with the Kernel SVM model 

After trying several models for the classification, the Kernel SVM(Support Vector Machine) turned out to have the highest accuracy. 
Health is a very delicate field and accuracy isn't meant to be tossed with, hence why the highest accuracy was chosen. 

This is just for practice as I would be building more complex models from scratch.
